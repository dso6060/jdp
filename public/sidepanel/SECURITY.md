# Security Guidelines

## 🔒 Security Overview

This project handles sensitive data and requires strict security measures. Follow these guidelines to maintain security.

## 🚨 Critical Security Rules

### 1. Never Commit Secrets
- ❌ **NEVER** commit files with hardcoded secrets
- ❌ **NEVER** commit production configuration
- ❌ **NEVER** commit API keys or access tokens
- ❌ **NEVER** commit Google Sheet IDs

### 2. Use Environment Variables
- ✅ Use `.env` files for local development
- ✅ Use Google Apps Script Properties for production
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Use different keys for different environments

### 3. Repository Structure
```
jdc/
├── production/           # PRIVATE - Never commit
│   ├── secrets/         # Production secrets
│   ├── apps-script/     # Google Apps Script files
│   └── logs/           # Production logs
├── temp/               # Temporary files (ignored)
└── [public files]      # Safe to commit
```
