Thank you for using the **Justice Definitions Extension**. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use the Extension. By installing and using the Extension, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## Information Collection and Usage:

### Personal Information:

The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about its users. We do not track, log, or retain any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or contact details.

### Extension Functionality:

The Extension is designed to work on every webpage you visit, allowing it to read and manipulate the content on those webpages for specific functionalities as described in the Extension's features.

### Data Collection for Missing Definitions:

When you request a definition for a term that is not found in our database, the Extension may collect and transmit the following information to our webhook service:
- The term you searched for
- The URL of the webpage where you made the request
- A timestamp of when the request was made

This data is used solely for the purpose of improving our definition database and is stored in a Google Sheet for expert review. No personal information is collected or transmitted.

### Offline Pages or Files:

The Extension operates exclusively within the context of webpages while you are browsing online. It does not interact with or function on offline pages or files stored on your device.

## Information Access:

The Extension can access the webpages you visit to perform its intended functions. The Extension is capable of reading and manipulating the content on webpages to provide its services. However, it does not alter or modify any data on websites permanently.

We want to assure you that the Extension neither collects nor stores any data related to its users. It operates entirely without logging or retaining any personal information, ensuring your privacy remains intact. However, as with any online service, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
