# Request Definition Popup Fix

## Problem Identified

The "Request Definition" popup was not working due to several issues:

1. **Invalid Webhook URL**: The code was using `https://your-server-domain.com/webhook` which is a placeholder URL that doesn't exist, causing `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors.

2. **Missing Server Configuration**: The webhook endpoint was hardcoded to a non-existent domain instead of using proper server configuration.

3. **No Error Handling**: The popup didn't provide clear feedback when the webhook endpoint was not configured.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `content.js`
- Removed hardcoded placeholder webhook URL
- Added `initializeWebhookEndpoint()` function to set webhook URL from configuration
- Added webhook availability checks before making requests
- Added proper error messages when webhook is not configured

### 2. Updated `popup/popup.js`
- Removed hardcoded placeholder webhook URL
- Added `initializeWebhookUrl()` function to set webhook URL from configuration
- Added webhook availability check in request function
- Added proper error message when webhook is not configured

### 3. Updated `config.js`
- Added `WEBHOOK_SERVER_URL` constant for the webhook server
- Updated `fetchServerConfig()` to include webhook endpoint in configuration
- Added webhook endpoint to default configuration

## Configuration Required

To make the webhook functionality work, you need to:

1. **Deploy the server** (`server.js`) to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, Railway, Vercel)
2. **Update the webhook server URL** in `config.js`:
   ```javascript
   const WEBHOOK_SERVER_URL = "https://your-actual-server.com"; // Replace with your deployed server URL
   ```
3. **Set environment variables** on your server:
   - `WEBHOOK_URL`: Your Google Apps Script webhook URL
   - `WEBHOOK_ACCESS_KEY`: Access key for webhook validation
   - `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING`: Set to 'true' to enable rate limiting
   - `ENABLE_ACCESS_KEY_VALIDATION`: Set to 'true' to enable access key validation

## Testing the Fix

1. **Without webhook configured**: The popup will show "Webhook Not Configured" message instead of failing silently
2. **With webhook configured**: The popup will attempt to submit requests to the configured webhook endpoint
3. **Error handling**: Proper error messages are shown for network issues, rate limiting, etc.

## Files Modified

- `content.js`: Added webhook initialization and error handling
- `popup/popup.js`: Added webhook initialization and error handling  
- `config.js`: Added webhook server configuration

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the server to a hosting service
2. Update the `WEBHOOK_SERVER_URL` in `config.js` with your actual server URL
3. Test the "Request Definition" functionality
4. Monitor server logs for webhook requests

The popup should now work properly and provide clear feedback to users about the webhook status.
